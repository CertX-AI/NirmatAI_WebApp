## Project Overview

The **NirmatAI Submission System** is built using Streamlit, a Python framework for creating interactive web applications. It enables users to:

- Authenticate with a username (minimum 8 characters).
- Upload documents in various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
- Upload and validate requirements in Excel format.
- Review uploaded files and initiate processing.
- Manage data per user with secure storage.

This system is particularly useful for organizations needing a streamlined way to collect and process documents and requirements from multiple users.

---

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login with username validation and tracking user with MLFlow.
- **Multi-format Document Upload**: Supports PDF, DOCX, and TXT files.
- **Excel Requirement Upload**: Validates Excel files against required columns.
- **Session Management**: Utilizes `st.session_state` for stateful interactions.
- **Dynamic UI Updates**: Immediate interface updates upon actions like login/logout.
- **Data Persistence**: Stores files in a structured directory per user.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear messages for user actions and validations.
- **Custom Styling**: Enhanced UI with custom CSS for a better user experience.

- Internet connection for installing dependencies.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

### Steps to Clone the Repository

1. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt**

  - **Windows**: You can use Git Bash or Command Prompt.
  - **macOS/Linux**: Use Terminal.

2. **Test SSH Connection (Optional but Recommended)**

   Before cloning, verify that you can connect to the Git server via SSH:

   ```bash
   ssh git@192.168.1.60
   ```

   - If this is your first time connecting, you may be prompted to accept the server's host key.
   - If you receive a permission denied error, ensure your SSH keys are correctly configured.

3. **Clone the Repository**

   Navigate to the directory where you want to install the application and run:

   ```bash
   git clone git@192.168.1.60:CertX/NirmatAI_WebApp.git
   ```

   cd /path/to/your/projects
   git clone git@192.168.1.60:CertX/NirmatAI_WebApp.git
   ```

4. Navigate to the Project Directory

   ```bash
   cd NirmatAI_WebApp
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Ensure `requirements.txt` includes:

   ```
   streamlit
   pandas
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   streamlit run nirmatai_webapp/streamlit_app.py --server.port=8501
   ```

## Usage Guide

### User Authentication

Upon launching the app:

- **Login Process**:
  - Enter a username with at least **8 characters**.
  - Click the **"Login"** button.
  - The app will rerun, and you'll see a welcome message in the sidebar.
- **Username Validation**:
  - The app uses a regex check to ensure the username meets the length requirement.
  - If invalid, an error message prompts for a correct username.
- **Logout Process**:
  - Click the **"Logout"** button in the sidebar.
  - The session resets, and you'll return to the login prompt.

**Note**: The system currently uses a placeholder authentication mechanism. For production, integrate a secure authentication system.

## Directory Structure

Upon uploads, the app creates a structured directory:

```
NirmatAI_WebApp/
â”œâ”€â”€ .forgejo
    â””â”€â”€ workflows/
        â””â”€â”€  deploy.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ uploaded_files/
    â”œâ”€â”€ userx/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ documents/
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ file1.pdf
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ file2.docx
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ requirements/
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ requirements.xlsx
    â””â”€â”€ usery/
        â”œâ”€â”€ documents/
        â””â”€â”€ requirements/
â”œâ”€â”€ nirmatai_webapp
    â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_nirmatai_sdk.py
    â””â”€â”€ streamlit_app.py
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ .pre-commit-config.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile.client
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile.dev
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile
â”œâ”€â”€ open_webapp.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ webapp_config.yml
```

- **`uploaded_files/`**: Root folder for all user uploads.
- **`<username>/`**: Folder named after the logged-in user.
- **`documents/`**: Stores uploaded documents.
- **`requirements/`**: Stores the uploaded requirements Excel file.

---

## Session Management

The app uses `st.session_state` to:

- Maintain login status (`logged_in`, `username`).
- Store uploaded files (`uploaded_docs`, `requirements_df`).
- Keep track of file names (`requirements_file_name`).

**Key Points**:

- **State Persistence**: Data persists across tabs during the session.
- **State Reset**: Logging out resets the session state.
- **UI Updates**: The app reruns upon login/logout to reflect changes.

---

## Customization

You can customize the application to suit your needs:

- **UI Styling**: Modify the `custom_css` string to change the look and feel.
- **Authentication**: Integrate with an actual authentication system.
- **File Processing Logic**: Replace placeholder processing code with actual functionality.
- **Validation Rules**: Adjust regex patterns or file validation logic as needed.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Login Issues**:
  - Ensure the username is at least 8 characters.
  - Check for any whitespace or special characters that might affect the regex.
- **File Upload Errors**:
  - Verify file formats are supported.
  - Ensure the Excel file contains all required columns.
- **Session Problems**:
  - If the app doesn't update after actions, try refreshing the page.
  - Check the console for any error messages.
